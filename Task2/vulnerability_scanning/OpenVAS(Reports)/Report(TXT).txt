NVT:    Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb) Multiple RCE Vulnerabilities
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108010
Threat: High (CVSS: 10.0)
Port:   8787/tcp

Summary:
Systems using Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb), which is available in Ruby versions !
1.6
  and later, may permit unauthorized systems to execute distributed commands.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The service is running in $SAFE >= 1 mode. However it is still possible to run a!
rbitrary syscall commands on the remote host. Sending an invalid syscall the ser!
vice returned the following response:
Flo:Errno::ENOSYS:bt["3/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1555:in `syscall'"0/usr/lib/!

Impact:
By default, Distributed Ruby does not impose restrictions on allowed hosts or se!
t the
  $SAFE environment variable to prevent privileged activities. If other controls!
 are not in place, especially if the
  Distributed Ruby process runs with elevated privileges, an attacker could exec!
ute arbitrary system commands or Ruby
  scripts on the Distributed Ruby server. An attacker may need to know only the !
URI of the listening Distributed Ruby
  server to submit Ruby commands.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Administrators of environments that rely on Distributed Ruby should ensure that
  appropriate controls are in place. Code-level controls may include:
  - Implementing taint on untrusted input
  - Setting $SAFE levels appropriately (>=2 is recommended if untrusted hosts ar!
e allowed to submit Ruby commands, and >=3 may be appropriate)
  - Including drb/acl.rb to set ACLEntry to restrict access to trusted hosts

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Send a crafted command to the service and check for a remote command execution
  via the instance_eval or syscall requests.

Threat: High (CVSS: 10.0)
Port:   512/tcp

Summary:
This remote host is running a rexec service.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The rexec service was detected on the target system.

Solution:

Impact:
Exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to view the source
  code of files in the context of the server process. This may allow the attacke!
r to obtain
  sensitive information and to run arbitrary PHP code on the affected computer. !
Other attacks are
  also possible.

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
PHP: Update to version 5.3.13, 5.4.3 or later
  - Other products / applications: Please contact the vendor for a solution

Affected Software/OS:
PHP versions prior to 5.3.13 and 5.4.x prior to 5.4.3.
  Other products / applications might be affected by the tested CVE-2012-1823 as!
 well.

Vulnerability Insight:
When PHP is used in a CGI-based setup (such as Apache's
  mod_cgid), the php-cgi receives a processed query string parameter as command !
line arguments which
  allows command-line switches, such as -s, -d or -c to be passed to the php-cgi!
 binary, which can
  be exploited to disclose source code and obtain arbitrary code execution.
  An example of the -s command, allowing an attacker to view the source code of !
index.php is below:
  http://example.com/index.php?-s

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Send multiple a crafted HTTP POST requests and checks the
  responses.
  Note: This script checks for the presence of CVE-2012-1823 which indicates tha!
t the system is also
  affected by the other included CVEs.

Summary:
Try to log in with given passwords via VNC protocol.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was possible to connect to the VNC server with the password: password

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Change the password to something hard to guess or enable
  password protection at all.

Vulnerability Insight:
This script tries to authenticate to a VNC server with the
  passwords set in the password preference. It will also test and report if no a!
uthentication /
  password is required at all.
  Note: Some VNC servers have a blacklisting scheme that blocks IP addresses aft!
er five unsuccessful
  connection attempts for a period of time. The script will abort the brute forc!
e attack if it
  encounters that it gets blocked.
  Note as well that passwords can be max. 8 characters long.

NVT:    Java RMI Server Insecure Default Configuration RCE Vulnerability - Active Check
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.140051
Threat: High (CVSS: 7.5)
Port:   1099/tcp

Summary:
Multiple Java products that implement the RMI Server contain a
  vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute !
arbitrary code
  (remote code execution/RCE) on a targeted system with elevated privileges.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
By doing an RMI request it was possible to trigger the vulnerability and make th!
e remote host sending a request back to the scanner host (Details on the receive!
d packet follows).
Destination IP:   192.168.0.220 (receiving IP on scanner host side)
Destination port: 16061/tcp (receiving port on scanner host side)
Originating IP:   192.168.0.199 (originating IP from target host side)

Impact:
An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the
  vulnerability by transmitting crafted packets to the affected software. When t!
he packets are
  processed, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system with elevat!
ed privileges.

Solution:
Solution type: Workaround
Disable class-loading. Please contact the vendor of the
  affected system for additional guidance.

Vulnerability Insight:
The vulnerability exists because of an incorrect default
  configuration of the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Server in the affected sof!
tware.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Sends a crafted JRMI request and checks if the target is
  connecting back to the scanner host.
  Note: For a successful detection of this flaw the target host needs to be able!
 to reach the
  scanner host on a TCP port randomly generated during the runtime of the VT (cu!
rrently in the
  range of 10000-32000).

NVT:    Anonymous FTP Login Reporting
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.900600
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 6.4)
Port:   21/tcp

Summary:
Reports if the remote FTP Server allows anonymous logins.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was possible to login to the remote FTP service with the following anonymous !
account(s):
anonymous:anonymous@example.com
ftp:anonymous@example.com

Impact:
Based on the files accessible via this anonymous FTP login and
  the permissions of this account an attacker might be able to:
  - gain access to sensitive files
  - upload or delete files.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
If you do not want to share files, you should disable anonymous
  logins.

Vulnerability Insight:
A host that provides an FTP service may additionally provide
  Anonymous FTP access as well. Under this arrangement, users do not strictly ne!
ed an account on the
  host. Instead the user typically enters 'anonymous' or 'ftp' when prompted for!
 username. Although
  users are commonly asked to send their email address as their password, little!
 to no verification
  is actually performed on the supplied data.
  Remark: NIST don't see 'configuration issues' as software flaws so the referen!
ced CVE has a
  severity of 0.0. The severity of this VT has been raised by Greenbone to still!
 report a
  configuration issue on the target.

NVT:    jQuery < 1.9.0 XSS Vulnerability
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.141636
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 6.1)
Port:   80/tcp

Summary:
jQuery is prone to a cross-site scripting (XSS)
  vulnerability.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Installed version: 1.3.2
Fixed version:     1.9.0
Installation
path / port:       /mutillidae/javascript/ddsmoothmenu/jquery.min.js
Detection info (see OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.150658 for more info):
- Identified file: http://192.168.0.199/mutillidae/javascript/ddsmoothmenu/jquer!
y.min.js
- Referenced at:   http://192.168.0.199/mutillidae/

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Update to version 1.9.0 or later.

Affected Software/OS:
jQuery prior to version 1.9.0.

Vulnerability Insight:
The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors
  from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whe!
ther the input was
  HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers!
 more flexibility
  when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery on!
ly deems the input
  to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitabi!
lity only to
  attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks if a vulnerable version is present on the target host.

NVT:    SSL/TLS: Report Weak Cipher Suites
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103440
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 5.9)
Port:   5432/tcp

Product detection result: cpe:/a:ietf:transport_layer_security
Detected by: SSL/TLS: Report Supported Cipher Suites (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.802067)

Summary:
This routine reports all weak SSL/TLS cipher suites accepted by
  a service.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
'Weak' cipher suites accepted by this service via the SSLv3 protocol:
TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
'Weak' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.0 protocol:
TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

Impact:
This could allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
  or have other, unspecified impacts.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
The configuration of this services should be changed so that it
  does not accept the listed weak cipher suites anymore.
  Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task.

Affected Software/OS:
All services providing an encrypted communication using weak
  SSL/TLS cipher suites.

Vulnerability Insight:
These rules are applied for the evaluation of the cryptographic
  strength:
  - RC4 is considered to be weak (CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808)
  - Ciphers using 64 bit or less are considered to be vulnerable to brute force !
methods and
  therefore considered as weak (CVE-2015-4000)
  - 1024 bit RSA authentication is considered to be insecure and therefore as we!
ak
  - Any cipher considered to be secure for only the next 10 years is considered !
as medium
  - Any other cipher is considered as strong

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks previous collected cipher suites.
  NOTE: No severity for SMTP services with 'Opportunistic TLS' and weak cipher s!
uites on port 25/tcp
  is reported. If too strong cipher suites are configured for this service the a!
lternative would be
  to fall back to an even more insecure cleartext communication.

Product detection result: cpe:/a:ietf:transport_layer_security:1.0
Detected by: SSL/TLS: Version Detection (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.105782)

Summary:
It was possible to detect the usage of the deprecated SSLv2
  and/or SSLv3 protocol on this system.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
In addition to TLSv1.0+ the service is also providing the deprecated SSLv2 and S!
SLv3 protocols and supports one or more ciphers. Those supported ciphers can be !
found in the 'SSL/TLS: Report Supported Cipher Suites' (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1!
.0.802067) VT.

Impact:
An attacker might be able to use the known cryptographic flaws to
  eavesdrop the connection between clients and the service to get access to sens!
itive data
  transferred within the secured connection.
  Furthermore newly uncovered vulnerabilities in this protocols won't receive se!
curity updates
  anymore.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
It is recommended to disable the deprecated SSLv2 and/or SSLv3
  protocols in favor of the TLSv1.2+ protocols.
  Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task.

Affected Software/OS:
All services providing an encrypted communication using the
  SSLv2 and/or SSLv3 protocols.

Vulnerability Insight:
The SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols contain known cryptographic flaws
  like:
  - CVE-2014-3566: Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE)
  - CVE-2016-0800: Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption (DROWN)

An attacker might be able to use the known cryptographic flaws to
  eavesdrop the connection between clients and the service to get access to sens!
itive data
  transferred within the secured connection.
  Furthermore newly uncovered vulnerabilities in this protocols won't receive se!
curity updates
  anymore.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
It is recommended to disable the deprecated SSLv2 and/or SSLv3
  protocols in favor of the TLSv1.2+ protocols.
  Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task.

Impact:
An attacker can quickly break individual connections.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Disable the reported weak KEX algorithm(s)
  - 1024-bit MODP group / prime KEX algorithms:
  Alternatively use elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellmann in general, e.g. Curve 25519.

Vulnerability Insight:
- 1024-bit MODP group / prime KEX algorithms:
  Millions of HTTPS, SSH, and VPN servers all use the same prime numbers for Dif!
fie-Hellman key
  exchange. Practitioners believed this was safe as long as new key exchange mes!
sages were generated
  for every connection. However, the first step in the number field sieve-the mo!
st efficient
  algorithm for breaking a Diffie-Hellman connection-is dependent only on this p!
rime.
  A nation-state can break a 1024-bit prime.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks the supported KEX algorithms of the remote SSH server.
  Currently weak KEX algorithms are defined as the following:
  - non-elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellmann (DH) KEX algorithms with 1024-bit MODP gr!
oup / prime
  - ephemerally generated key exchange groups uses SHA-1
  - using RSA 1024-bit modulus key

NVT:    SSL/TLS: Renegotiation DoS Vulnerability (CVE-2011-1473, CVE-2011-5094)
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.117761
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 5.0)
Port:   25/tcp

Summary:
The remote SSL/TLS service is prone to a denial of service (DoS)
  vulnerability.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following indicates that the remote SSL/TLS service is affected:
Protocol Version | Successful re-done SSL/TLS handshakes (Renegotiation) over an!
 existing / already established SSL/TLS connection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
--------------------------------------------------
TLSv1.0          | 10

Impact:
The flaw might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a
  DoS (CPU consumption) by performing many renegotiations within a single connec!
tion.

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Users should contact their vendors for specific patch information.
  A general solution is to remove/disable renegotiation capabilities altogether !
from/in the affected
  SSL/TLS service.

Affected Software/OS:
Every SSL/TLS service which does not properly restrict
  client-initiated renegotiation.

Vulnerability Insight:
The flaw exists because the remote SSL/TLS service does not
  properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS protoc!
ols.
  Note: The referenced CVEs are affecting OpenSSL and Mozilla Network Security S!
ervices (NSS) but
  both are in a DISPUTED state with the following rationale:
  > It can also be argued that it is the responsibility of server deployments, n!
ot a security
  library, to prevent or limit renegotiation when it is inappropriate within a s!
pecific environment.
  Both CVEs are still kept in this VT as a reference to the origin of this flaw.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks if the remote service allows to re-do the same SSL/TLS
  handshake (Renegotiation) over an existing / already established SSL/TLS conne!
ction.

Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.3)
Port:   22/tcp

Product detection result: cpe:/a:ietf:secure_shell_protocol
Detected by: SSH Protocol Algorithms Supported (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.105565)

Summary:
The remote SSH server is configured to allow / support weak
  encryption algorithm(s).

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The remote SSH server supports the following weak client-to-server encryption al!
gorithm(s):
3des-cbc
aes128-cbc

aes256-cbc
arcfour
arcfour128
arcfour256
blowfish-cbc
cast128-cbc
rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Disable the reported weak encryption algorithm(s).

Vulnerability Insight:
- The 'arcfour' cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit
  keys. The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCH!
NEIER]. Arcfour
  (and RC4) has problems with weak keys, and should not be used anymore.
  - The 'none' algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done. Note that t!
his method provides
  no confidentiality protection, and it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.
  - A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow a!
n attacker to
  recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks the supported encryption algorithms (client-to-server
  and server-to-client) of the remote SSH server.
  Currently weak encryption algorithms are defined as the following:
  - Arcfour (RC4) cipher based algorithms
  - 'none' algorithm
  - CBC mode cipher based algorithms

Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.3)
Port:   25/tcp

Product detection result: cpe:/a:ietf:transport_layer_security
Detected by: SSL/TLS: Report Supported Cipher Suites (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.802067)

Summary:
This host is accepting 'RSA_EXPORT' cipher suites and is prone
  to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) vulnerability.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
'RSA_EXPORT' cipher suites accepted by this service via the SSLv3 protocol:
TLS_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5
'RSA_EXPORT' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.0 protocol:
TLS_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5

Impact:
Successful exploitation will allow remote attacker to downgrade
  the security of a session to use 'RSA_EXPORT' cipher suites, which are signifi!
cantly weaker than
  non-export cipher suites. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to more !
easily break the
  encryption and monitor or tamper with the encrypted stream.

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
- Remove support for 'RSA_EXPORT' cipher suites from the
  service. Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this!

Detected by: SSL/TLS: Version Detection (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.105782)

Summary:
It was possible to detect the usage of the deprecated TLSv1.0
  and/or TLSv1.1 protocol on this system.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The service is only providing the deprecated TLSv1.0 protocol and supports one o!
r more ciphers. Those supported ciphers can be found in the 'SSL/TLS: Report Sup!
ported Cipher Suites' (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.802067) VT.

Impact:
An attacker might be able to use the known cryptographic flaws to
  eavesdrop the connection between clients and the service to get access to sens!
itive data
  transferred within the secured connection.
  Furthermore newly uncovered vulnerabilities in this protocols won't receive se!
curity updates
  anymore.

Solution:

utside US,C=XX
Signature Algorithm:  sha1WithRSAEncryption

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Servers that use SSL/TLS certificates signed with a weak SHA-1, MD5, MD4 or MD2 !
hashing algorithm will need to obtain new
  SHA-2 signed SSL/TLS certificates to avoid web browser SSL/TLS certificate war!
nings.

Vulnerability Insight:
The following hashing algorithms used for signing SSL/TLS certificates are consi!
dered cryptographically weak
  and not secure enough for ongoing use:
  - Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)
  - Message Digest 5 (MD5)
  - Message Digest 4 (MD4)
  - Message Digest 2 (MD2)
  Beginning as late as January 2017 and as early as June 2016, browser developer!
s such as Microsoft and Google will begin warning users when visiting
  web sites that use SHA-1 signed Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates.
  NOTE: The script preference allows to set one or more custom SHA-1 fingerprint!
s of CA certificates which are trusted by this routine. The fingerprints
  needs to be passed comma-separated and case-insensitive:
  Fingerprint1
  or
  fingerprint1, Fingerprint2

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Check which hashing algorithm was used to sign the remote SSL/TLS certificate.

NVT:    SSL/TLS: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Insufficient DH Group Strength Vulnerability
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.106223
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.0)
Port:   25/tcp

Summary:
The SSL/TLS service uses Diffie-Hellman groups with insufficient
  strength (key size < 2048).

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Server Temporary Key Size: 1024 bits

Impact:
An attacker might be able to decrypt the SSL/TLS communication
  offline.

Solution:
Solution type: Workaround
- Deploy (Ephemeral) Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) or use
  a 2048-bit or stronger Diffie-Hellman group. Please see the references for mor!
e resources
  supporting you with this task.
  - For Apache Web Servers: Beginning with version 2.4.7, mod_ssl will use DH pa!
rameters which
  include primes with lengths of more than 1024 bits.

Affected Software/OS:
All services providing an encrypted communication using
  Diffie-Hellman groups with insufficient strength.

Vulnerability Insight:
The Diffie-Hellman group are some big numbers that are used as
  base for the DH computations. They can be, and often are, fixed. The security !
of the final secret
  depends on the size of these parameters. It was found that 512 and 768 bits to!

Threat: Low (CVSS: 3.7)
Port:   25/tcp

Product detection result: cpe:/a:ietf:transport_layer_security
Detected by: SSL/TLS: Report Supported Cipher Suites (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.802067)

Summary:
This host is accepting 'DHE_EXPORT' cipher suites and is prone
  to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) vulnerability.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
'DHE_EXPORT' cipher suites accepted by this service via the SSLv3 protocol:
TLS_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5
'DHE_EXPORT' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.0 protocol:
TLS_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5

Impact:
Successful exploitation will allow a man-in-the-middle attacker
  to downgrade the security of a TLS session to 512-bit export-grade cryptograph!
y, which is
  significantly weaker, allowing the attacker to more easily break the encryptio!
n and monitor or
  tamper with the encrypted stream.

Solution:

NVT:    TCP Timestamps Information Disclosure
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows
  to compute the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323/RFC7323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 1865667
Packet 2: 1865773

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line
  'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to appl!
y the settings at
  runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Tim!
estamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating co!
mmunication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by
  RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in
  between to the target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If foun!
d, the timestamps
  are reported.

Summary:
The remote SSH server is configured to allow / support weak MAC
  algorithm(s).

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The remote SSH server supports the following weak client-to-server MAC algorithm!
(s):
hmac-md5
hmac-md5-96

The remote SSH server supports the following weak server-to-client MAC algorithm!
(s):
hmac-md5
hmac-md5-96
hmac-sha1-96
umac-64@openssh.com

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Disable the reported weak MAC algorithm(s).

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks the supported MAC algorithms (client-to-server and
  server-to-client) of the remote SSH server.
  Currently weak MAC algorithms are defined as the following:
  - MD5 based algorithms
  - 96-bit based algorithms
  - 64-bit based algorithms
  - 'none' algorithm

NVT:    ICMP Timestamp Reply Information Disclosure
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103190
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.1)
Port:   general/icmp

Summary:
The remote host responded to an ICMP timestamp request.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following response / ICMP packet has been received:
- ICMP Type: 14
- ICMP Code: 0

Impact:
This information could theoretically be used to exploit weak
  time-based random number generators in other services.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Various mitigations are possible:
  - Disable the support for ICMP timestamp on the remote host completely
  - Protect the remote host by a firewall, and block ICMP packets passing throug!
h the firewall in
  either direction (either completely or only for untrusted networks)

Vulnerability Insight:
The Timestamp Reply is an ICMP message which replies to a
  Timestamp message. It consists of the originating timestamp sent by the sender!
 of the Timestamp as
  well as a receive timestamp and a transmit timestamp.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Sends an ICMP Timestamp (Type 13) request and checks if a
  Timestamp Reply (Type 14) is received.
