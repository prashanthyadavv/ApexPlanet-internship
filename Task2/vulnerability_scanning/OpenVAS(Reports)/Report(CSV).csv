If you're seeing this page, and you don't think you should be, then either you're either a user who has arrived at new installation of Tomcat, or you're an administrator who hasn't got his/her setup quite right.

            <p><b>NOTE:</b> This page is precompiled. If you change it, this page will not change since
                  it was compiled into a servlet at build time.

  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Timestamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating communication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
